         <video:title>The Pros and Cons of Ajax Ontario | Living in Ajax Ontario</video:title>
         <video:description>Is Ajax Ontario a good place to live? Ajax Ontario is a growing community, and more and more people are asking about moving to Ajax Ontario every day! Not everything is rainbows and roses in Ajax, though. There are definitely a few things you should know before you move here!

One of the top pros is the fact that Ajax has relatively more affordable real estate than other cities in the Greater Toronto Area. Ajax has also seen a lot of growth over the years, making it a town that families across the board are moving to. It&apos;s an amazing place to live - is why I chose to move to Ajax myself! 

If you’re looking to move to Ajax Ontario, you definitely need to have the right Real Estate Agent working with you to secure your home. Be sure to reach out to me before you make that move to Ajax!

         <video:title>This is the TRUTH about the Calgary economy.</video:title>
         <video:description>In this video, I take a boots-on-the-ground approach to show you the construction of a massive facility next to a mostly empty commercial real estate development in Calgary.

I talk about the incoming recession here in 2022 and the changing environment because of interest rates and inflation. Most of the buildings behind me that aren&apos;t vacant are Alberta Health units 👀 it&apos;s a crazy time that we live in and now is the time to prepare.

Everybody likes to talk about residential real estate and the housing market however commercial real estate is very important. It&apos;s even more important after the health crisis made so much of it go vacant. This could be a catalyst for a financial crisis and a worse housing market crash. So many REITs are losing so much money as these things sit empty.

         <video:title>Things to do in Calgary with a Family | Fun Active Activities</video:title>
         <video:description>This video was sponsored by Tourism Calgary: https://www.visitcalgary.com/

In this video, our family heads to the big city for some concrete jungle fun. We explore a plethora of great family activities from the Calgary science center (Telus Spark Center), Granary Road Active Learning Park, The Paddle Station, B-Line indoor bike park, Winsports Skyline luge, and even road some rides at Heritage Park. This was an amazing weekend in Calgary with all sorts of great adventures and we are so happy to get to share them with you. 

Below is a description of each activity along with the link to their website. We hope you find this content helpful when planning things to do in Calgary. 

Telus Spark Center  - Also known as the Calgary Science Center is a unique interactive learning center that is great for families of all ages. With over 200 unique interactive science displays it is easy to burn an afternoon here.  

https://www.sparkscience.ca/

Granary Road Calgary -  Granary Road is not only a farmers market but also a 36-acre property housing a 3 km trail network that connects 11 imaginative play areas and animal themes learning experiences. If you want to get your kids out for a day and visit some animals all while making it a learning opportunity Granary Road is a great place to go.

B-Line Indoor Bike Park - B-line is a great bike park located inside the city of Calgary. This 60,000 square foot facility houses a number of different ramps, foam pits, quarter pipes, rollers and so much more. If you like biking or are even looking to learn with your kids B-Line is a great family-friendly place to spend the afternoon.

Heritage Park Calgary -  Heritage Park is a living history museum with 127 acres of family fun hidden throughout. They have so many great activities from a cruise on the S.S Moyie a 1860’s paddle steamer to excited child-friendly rides like Ferris wheels and delicious food stands scattered throughout. Although we did not get through the entire park as it would take more than 1 day to do. We hope this gives you an idea of what this park has to offer. 

https://www.heritagepark.ca/

Winsport Skyline Luge -  Winsport once called Canada Olympic Park is the local ski hill in Calgary. During the summer they have all sorts of different activities you can do there from mountain biking to a downhill go-karting course.

The Paddle Station Calgary - This activity allows you to float the Bow River and get a whole different perspective of the city. Starting in shouldice park they suite you up in safety equipment give you a rundown of what the float will be like and send you on a 13km journey down the river. This is great to do with a family on a hot sunny afternoon.
